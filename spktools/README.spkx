SPKx is a tool that allows the extraction of files from an SPK package/archive.
It can write the contents of the virtual file either to a real file or to stdout.
Its codebase is way cleaner than that of genSPK and it doesn't use any tricks.
It can also be used as another example for libspk and is helpful for live demonstrations.
