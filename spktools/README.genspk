This program may ask your cat for the package you should have recieved two days ago, feed your neighbour and then explode. Twice.
In other words: The source code is pretty much the worst to be found in this repository. It contains hard-coded values and more evil things than you can poke a stick at. It might segfault every minute now. If it should choose to explode, you're on your own.

Nevertheless, here is at least a little bit of documentation:
You invoke the genspk tool with two parameters.
The first one being the name of the file you want to create (e.g. out.spk) and the second one being the directory you want to package into the file.

Example:
./genspk out.spk indir
